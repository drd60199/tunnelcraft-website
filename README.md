**TunnelCraft: The Dev & IT Resource Hub**

**Project Description**

TunnelCraft is an educational resource and blog for aspiring developers and IT professionals. The
Site is a personal initiative to document and share the process of building and managing tech,
one small project at a time. Through a series of consistent, hands-on projects, the goal is to
provide practical guides and resources to help others on their tech journey.

**Key Features**
- **Single-Page Layout**: The entire website is a single, continuous-scroll page for a modern
  and simplified user experience.

- **Dynamic Navigation**: The navigation bar intelligently updates to show either "Login" and
  "sign Up" or a "Welcome" message with a "Logout" link, based on the user's session status.

- **Modern Design**: The site features a modernized aesthetic with a dark color scheme,
  dynamic gradient text, and rounded elements to create a more friendly and inviting feel.

- **Flexible Layout**: The hero section uses a flexible, two-column layout to accommodate both
  text and a future graphic.

- **Community Access**: Registered users are granted access to a private Minecraft server,
  offering a unique perk and a way to build a community.

- **Social Integration**: The footer includes social media icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and
  Facebook, linking to the project owner's profiles.

- **Support System**: A donation system is in place to fund future projects, which will, in turn,
  provide new learning opportunities and resources for the community.

**Technologies Used**

- **HTML5**: For the website's structure and semantic layout.

- **CSS3**: For styling, including modern Flexbox layouts and dynamic effects.

- **JavaScript**: For client-side functionality, such as the mobile menu toggle.

- **PHP**: For server-side processing, including dynamic content based on user sessions and
  contact form submissions.
